1. The mode seems to have switched from Manual to Position Control at around 1 minutes 23 seconds; just short of 3 minutes flat.
2. The maximum velocity or speed was 3.4 km/h.
3. For x, the maximum deviation was over 0.5 meters; the estimated was around 0.2m but the drone actually moved over 0.7m away. For y, the maximum deviation was around 0.28, where it was supposed to move only around 0.12m but actually moved 0.4m. For z, the maximum deviation was over 1.2m - the drone was supposed to fly up 0.52m but instead flew down.
4. The drone seems to have gone in a circular, almost goat-like formation throughout the course of its flight. 
5. The maximum acceleration occurred when the drone acceleration downward (in the z direction) at a rate of -48 m/s^2.
6. The drone seems to have taken off at 0:00 minutes, and landed a few seconds after 3:00 minutes.
7. The greatest discrepancy between the setpoint (the desired z value) and the true height was around 1.2m - the drone was expected to fly up about 0.44m but instead flew down about 0.76m.
8. The parameter values for COM_POS_FS_EPH, EKF2_AID_MASK, and EKF2_HGT_MODE are 50000, 2, and 2, respectively.
